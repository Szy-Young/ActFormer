## ActFormer: A GAN-based Transformer towards General Action-Conditioned 3D Human Motion Generation (ICCV 2023)

[**Project Page**](https://liangxuy.github.io/actformer/) | [**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07706)

### Overview

We propose a GAN-based Transformer for general action-conditioned 3D human motion generation, including single-person actions and multi-person interactive actions.
